# mms-rs

A simple library to use rust for [mms](https://github.com/mackorone/mms).

## Using the example

- Check out the code and add a new mouse to mms.
- Point the `Directory` to the code you checked out.
- As `Build Command` use: `cargo build --release --example minimal-mouse`
- As `Run Command` use: `./target/release/examples/minimal-mouse`

After that you can run the example from within mms.

## Building your own

Add `mms-rs` to your dependencies with `cargo add mms-rs`. Then you can use the api in your own code.
